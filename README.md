# Seinfeld Clicky Game

* Welcome to Seinfeld Clicky Game! It is a memory game that is built with React.js using state, in order to keep track of all event changes. The goal of the game is to click each of the seinfeld characters, but you have to make sure you don't click on the same character twice!

* Everytime a character is clicked on, the character cards are reshuffled, making it harder to remember who you have clicked on and who you have not.

* The score for each individual game incremements as you guess a different character, as well as the high score that has been achieved throughout all play.

* Enjoy the fun with your friends from Seinfeld!
